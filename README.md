#### Warma's loot filter

A semi-minimal loot filter without intrusive visuals.

#### Concept

This loot filter is designed to be rather minimal - it only deviates slightly from the game's initial visual style and
aims to not show almost all items which could be of any value. It shows all rares and most relevant crafting recipes,
but further highlights more useful itemns. In addition, as it was designed during the era when loot filters were still
big resource hogs, the script is designed to be more lightweight than any of the other filters I've tried so far

#### Main features

* Moderately reduced clutter. White or magic items except for the very best maxlvl bases are never ever shown, not even while leveling.
* Rares are always shown. There is colour- and font size coding for chaos- and regal-recipe worthy rares and rares with good bases. Rares ineglible for chaos recipe are faded.
* Currency font size is large. I want to make currency picking easy, because I'm OCD enough to pick anything better than an orb of Alteration. Weakest currencies are faded.
* Everything is sound-coded based on type. Currency is also sound-coded based on value. Apart from the currency, there is no economic tiering.
* Recipes for chromatics, glassblowers, jewelers and chisels are displayed.
* Non-quality flasks are not shown, except for special flasks.
* Chancing recipes are NOT highlighted by default. Edit the relevant block to alter this.

#### Visual features

* From a visual design perspective, colors are used more liberally than in the base game, which may be a problem for purists.
* Jewels, uniques, rares, currency etc. use something akin to their default ingame colour scheme, except brighter. Special items which do not have a default scheme, have been coloured to be easily distinguishable.
* Most backgrounds are coloured, unlike in the base game. Mostly the background color is a darker version of the base colour.
